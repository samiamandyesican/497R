- pg. 25 (momentum)
- pg. 35-37 (far field)

## 5/3/24
Questions:
- pg. 12-13, "The lift and drag are normalized as follows..." and how it relates to pressure coefficient. <br><br>

New Objectives:
- read text
- start looking at XFoil
- set up GitHub next mentor meeting

## 5/7/24
Questions:
- Relationship between strouhal, froude (naval?), and reynolds numbers: [cylinder flow example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW0JfEBE9h8)
- Nondimensionalizing the Stoke's equation to define reynolds, froude, and strouhal numbers (pg. 19-20)? Ahhhh scary math 
- outflow
- Why won't julia read .dat filetypes? <br><br>

New Objectives:
- read rest of text and make notes of questions and stuff. Get the basics, and if you have time go back through.

## 5/17/24
Questions:
- I think I understand the relationship between flow separation and drag, but lift is a little more foggy
- why does XFoil completely go haywire beyond a certain alpha?

Objectives:
- markershape = square for experimental data
